## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I've moved...  my personal stuff.

You can find me again on the [Radicle](https://radicle.xyz) network.  See below...

I retain my presence here for projects I keep contributing to or working for.

## Radicle

My Radicle ID is `z6Mku8hpprWTmCv3BqkssCYDfr2feUdyLSUnycVajFo9XVAx`.  If you're already set up, this should show you my (public) repositories:

``` console
$ rad follow z6Mku8hpprWTmCv3BqkssCYDfr2feUdyLSUnycVajFo9XVAx
$ rad node routing --nid z6Mku8hpprWTmCv3BqkssCYDfr2feUdyLSUnycVajFo9XVAx
```

If you haven't set yourself up for using Radicle yet, you might want to have a look at their [User Guide](https://radicle.xyz/guides/user)
